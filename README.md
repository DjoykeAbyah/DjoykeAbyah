# 🦄 🚀 Welcome to Djoyke's GitHub Profile! 🚀 🦄

Hey there, fellow curious mind! My name is Djoyke, and I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile. Let me take a moment to introduce myself and share a glimpse into my coding journey.

## About Me

- 🎓 I'm currently a student at Codam Coding College, which is part of the innovative 42 network.
- 👨‍💻 I'm focusing on mastering the art of programming in C and C++, with some other languages in the near future.
- 🎨 When I'm not immersed in the world of code, I love to express my creativity through drawing, especially digital concept art (as you can see in my drawing below).

## What You'll Find Here

On my GitHub profile, you'll discover a variety of projects. I'm constantly working on exciting assignments that challenge me to think outside the box. Expect to find a mix of C, C++ and Java projects that showcase my progress along the way.

Feel free to explore my repositories, check out the code, and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have!

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out.

✨ Happy coding! ✨
